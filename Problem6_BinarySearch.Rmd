# Introduction

In this exercise, we will learn [binary search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm), which is to find a specific number in a sorted list. To use this search algorithm, you have to make sure that your list is ordered numerically. This exercise is related to bubble sort exercise.

If you have a number $A$ that you need to find out where it is in a list, binary search algorithm tell you that in following steps. Suppose the list has N elements.

- compare $A$ with the mean number ,$R_m$, of the list ($m := N/2$)
- if $A>R_m$, compare $A$ with $R_{m_2}$ ($m_2:= 3N/4$)
- if $A<R_m$, compare $A$ with $R_{m_2}$ ($m_2:= N/4$)


Here is the simple explanation.  

There is a list that has numbers. Suppose that you want to find where $T = 9$ is, but cannot find it at a glance. This might happens if you list has a hundreds of elements.


`(1,2,3,6,7,8,9)`



### First Step

Compare $T$ with $6$. In this case, $T>6$ then go to next step.

Divide the list into half,

`(1,2,3)`, `(7,8,9)`.

Because $Target>6$, we are interested in the latter list `(7,8,9)`.

### Second Step
 
You have

`(7,8,9)`.

Compare $Target$ with $8$. In this case, $Target>8$ then we have found where $Target=9$ is in the list.



# Question

- you have `ArrayToSearch <- sort(as.integer( runif(100, min = 1, max = 99) ))`
- Implement `binary search ` find where `T` is in `ArrayToSearch`
- In this excersise, set `T <- as.integer( runif(1, min = 1, max = 99)`.
- In the case `ArrayToSearch` dose not have the same number as `T`, print('can't find')

# Sample Answer


```{r}
binary <- function(ArrayToSearch,Target){
  
  N <- length(ArrayToSearch) #Number of factor
  Start <- 1
  End   <- N
  
  while(Start<End){
    Mid <- as.integer((Start + End)/2)
    if(ArrayToSearch[Mid] == Target){
      return(Mid)
    }else if(Target < ArrayToSearch[Mid]){
      End <- Mid 
    }else{
      Start <- Mid + 1
    }
  }
  print('Not found')
 }

ArrayToSearch <- sort(as.integer( runif(100, min = 1, max = 99) ))
Target <-  as.integer( runif(1, min = 1, max = 99) )

print(Target) 
ArrayToSearch[binary(ArrayToSearch,Target)]
print(ArrayToSearch)
```
